Pretty much anything goes. If you’ve got something to say, DM us on Facebook to reserve your spot. Registrations open Sunday April 23. 🎤</p>

                            <p>2016, we’d probably all agree, was a good contender for the King of Shitty Years. It was the year Donald Trump got elected and David Bowie died. Playing on the TV day and night, ever-present as static on a busted TV, Aleppo was burning.</p>
                            <p>Something in the cosmic balance was definitely way off.</p>
                            <p>Argyris Loizou managed to put it all into words that made the hair on the back of our necks stand on end for a full five minutes. It didn’t make us feel any better listening, but I think we all sighed a collective sigh of relief at feeling so bad together.</p>
                            <p>This recording is from our archives. It originally appeared on December 22, 2016.</p>

                            <p>On a Sunday evening, while yet another week of an infinite corporate cycle loomed over her, Kalli Koulloufidou took a look at her hands... and decided it would make absolutely no difference to the world if she chopped them off.</p>

                            <p>When we had our last Open Mic Night (online), things were pretty fucked up. Since then, they’ve gotten a lot more fucked up. And god knows it hasn’t been easy not being able to talk about it. For that reason — and because cold beer on a Sunday evening is a lot better than watching more crap on Netflix — we’re venturing back to the mic.</p>
                            <p>This time around we’re outside at Kala Kathoumena in Old Nicosia. It truly (truly) pains us not to be telling stories at Prozak Kafeneion, but for the time being we’re trying to make everyone comfortable. So outside it is.</p>
                            <p>Catch us at Kala Kathoumena at 17:00 Sunday 22 May, 2022. Bring your original stories, poems, songs, and inner pain and joy. You’ve got 5 minutes to rock our worlds.</p>
